### Isaac Lab – SO‑ARM100 / SO‑ARM101 Project

This repository implements tasks for the SO‑ARM100 and SO‑ARM101 robots using Isaac Lab. It serves as the foundation for several tutorials in the LycheeAI Hub series [Project: SO‑ARM101 × Isaac Sim × Isaac Lab](https://lycheeai-hub.com/project-so-arm101-x-isaac-sim-x-isaac-lab-tutorial-series).

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Install Isaac Lab by following the [official installation guide](https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab/main/source/setup/installation/index.html) (using conda).
2. Clone this repository **outside** the `IsaacLab` directory.
3. Install the package:

   ```bash
   python -m pip install -e source/SO_100
   ```

## 🚀 Quickstart

To list all available environments:

```bash
python scripts/list_envs.py
```

## 🐞 Debugging Tasks

Two scripts can help verify your setup:

**Zero Agent**

Sends zero commands to all robots, confirming that the environment loads correctly:

```bash
python scripts/zero_agent.py --task SO-ARM100-Reach-Play-v0
```

**Random Agent**

Sends random commands to all robots, confirming proper actuation:

```bash
python scripts/random_agent.py --task SO-ARM100-Reach-Play-v0
```

## 🏋️‍♂️ Training and Playback

You can train a policy for SO‑ARM100 / SO‑ARM101 tasks (for example, the **Reach** task, which is a basic RL-based IK) with the `rsl_rl` and/or `skrl` library:

```bash
python scripts/rsl_rl/train.py --task SO-ARM100-Reach-v0 --headless
```

After training, validate the learned policy:

```bash
python scripts/rsl_rl/play.py --task SO-ARM100-Reach-Play-v0
```

This ensures that your policy performs as expected in Isaac Lab before attempting real‑world transfer.
